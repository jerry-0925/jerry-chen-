Hi there, I‚Äòm (ZIRUI )JERRY CHEN! üëã

I am a high school senior and also researcher in music technology.

Most of my research focus on the overlap between the human experience with music using computer science. The interdisciplinary approach combining music, psychology, neuroscience and computer science is novel and intriguing to me.

üöÄ Technologies & Areas of Interest
- üß† AI / Deep learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Audio Signal Processing
- üåê Full-stack Development:Python (Flask), JavaScript, HTML/CSS,web app
- üî¨ passion issues:

1.Audio & Music Technology: Music Information Retrieval, Music Emotion Recognition

2.Computational Life Sciences:  Neuroscience

3.Human-Centered Design: Human-Computer Interaction, Music Therapy

 üèÜ Research issues

NO.1

|Title| [Nightingale](Nightingale/)

|Subject| Studied the perceived emotion from music combining EEG signals and audio features, aiming to explore its application in music therapy;

|Key Contributions|Reaching highest R squared value on regression study of the brain wave DEAP dataset, surpassing all current state-of-the-art;

|Honors| Paper under review for PLOS One journal. Science Fair 3rd place in LA County (with 50 participants in the category); Advanced into California State Science Fair



NO.2

|Title| [The Impact of Stereo Audio on the Electroencephalogram Signal of Users‚Äô Listening Experience](Analyze stereo audio/)

|Subject| Studies the effects of stereo audio on music listening. 

|Key Contributions| One of the very few studies in the field to conduct original experiments and analyze the impact of stereo audio (headphones). 

|Honors| Paper published at 2025 International Conference on Computers, Information Processing and Advanced Education (CIPAE). 


NO.3

|Title| [Unity game engine on spatial audio interactive environment. Assist with project Satie with Mateo](https://github.com/mateolarreaferro/SatieLang)

|Subject| Sound scaping with code, creating audio generation samples

|Key Contributions|Integrate prompt to audio pipelines like TangoFlux, ElevenLabs etc. to Satie, enabling users to generate multiple options of audio when there are no suitable ones in Satie library. Create a sample musical piece that replicates the experience of a cross country practice run. 

|Honors|Demo at a conference


NO.4

|Title| [Generated ASMR and its effect on human participants](ASMR generation/)

|Subject| Study on the generation of ASMR audio
Built a VQ-VAE AR generation model using data from YouTube-ASMR-300K dataset, can generate samples of percussive, friction, vocal and ambient sounds. One of the very first studies in the field of ASMR audio to replicate sound sources by automated methods. |key Contributions|Integrate prompt to audio pipelines like TangoFlux, ElevenLabs etc. to Satie, enabling users to generate multiple options of audio when there are no suitable ones in Satie library. Create a sample musical piece that replicates the experience of a cross country practice run. 

|Key Contributions| Develop the model to support generation; Design hardware and their corresponding controls to measure its effect. Stepping foot into a field very underexplored yet.

|Honors| Processing


NO.5

|Title| [The application of BERT in RBP (RNA-binding proteins) binding](RNA-protein-recovered/)

|Subject| Computational Biology to study RNA-protein binding

|Key Contributions|Developed a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) structure to improve prediction accuracy. Binary classification leads to Area Under Curve = 0.917.

|Honors|Delaware Country Science Fair second place
